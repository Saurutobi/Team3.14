To do:

1.) commit current raspberry pi files for backup

2.) create script to build the raspberry pi from a fresh install of raspbian, including:
  - install apache
  - create cronjob
  - place driver in correct place
  
3.) create script to build webserver from fresh ubuntu 14.04 LTS install, including:
  - install apache
  - install php/mcrypt
  - install mysql
  - copy site to appropriate directory
    - with application.php file that has a blank key
  - generate key
  - create cronjobs
  - run migrations
  
  - maybe make the script interactive, asking for sudo access, asking what GPIO, what sensor
    - make it so when it runs it'll be like "do you want a full install or to make changes", not sure
  
4.) build new laravel 4 version of our site

5.) finish DHT11/DHT22/AM2302 driver
