We need to create a logging make that will allow us to log all things
We need to find a coding standard for our program
We need to split off the input method as another program to test
We need to write a square root program
We need to create tests for
	input program
	Quadratic Plus program
	Quadratic Minus program
	Square Root Program

quadratic plus and minus will need a mock square root object
We need to determine if we are giving correct amounts of exactness

We need to create doxygen documentation

He will have stuff from the quadratic program on the final
	machine epsilon
	mock object

for mock objects
	expected result
	returned result
	relative error with the result

	sent
	count 
	error
