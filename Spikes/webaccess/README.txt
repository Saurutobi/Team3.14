Incredible though it seems, a couple of years from now
the latest red-hot project will have faded down to a dull
gray, and you’ll have a hard time remembering exactly
what the Wibble project was all about. So create a file
called README in the top-level project directory. Write
a small paragraph describing the project: the business
problems it is solving, the basic technologies used, and
so on. This isn’t meant to be a full description; it’s just
an aide-memoir intended to trigger those long-dormant
neurons when you come back after a long absence.
