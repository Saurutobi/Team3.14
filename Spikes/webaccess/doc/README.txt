As a placeholder, from "Pragmatic Version Control with Subversion":

Check all project documentation into doc and its sub-
directories. Don’t forget to add memos and e-mails that
describe decisions reached. It’s normal to have directo-
ries under doc that contain different document types or
for different phases of the project.

If your project needs external documentation (for exam-
ple, the description of an algorithm or a third-party file
format), consider copying this and storing it under the
doc directory tree (copyright permitting, of course). This
will make it easier for future maintainers if the external
site has since gone away. If you can’t copy this material
into your project, create a file in doc called BIBLIOGRAPHY
and add links and a brief description in it.
