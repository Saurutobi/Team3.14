As a placeholder, from "Pragmatic Version Control with Subversion":

If your project uses a database, store all the schema-
related stuff here. Work hard not to fall into the habit of
modifying schemas online. Have your database admin-
istrator create SQL scripts for each update—scripts that
both update the schema and migrate the data. By keep-
ing these in the repository, you’ll be able to migrate any
version of the database to any other version.
