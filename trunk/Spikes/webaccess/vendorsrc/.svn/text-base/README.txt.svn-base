As a placeholder, from "Pragmatic Version Control with Subversion":

Sometimes a project will import and include code from
a third party (for example, if it is using an open-source
library and needs to ensure that it will have access to a
particular version of the source for the life of the appli-
cation). You’ll include the binary libraries (and possibly
the header files) in the vendor directory, but you’ll also
want to retain the source from which these libraries were
built. Store these sources under the vendorsrc directory.
We have more to say about vendor source code in Chap-
ter 11, Third-Party Code, on page 141.
