Why was the @lert Temperature sensor chosen?
we should implement this because we already have space
create a driver module that talks to individual devices
could create a driver module that could talk to the cpu to get temp of other computers

What rooms are the sensors installed in?

How many people are currently using this system(the one made by the senior design team)?

What are other solutions to temperature sensing that other areas of campus are using?


another framework that we could use is cakephp -- module view control
these kind of decisions can be put into our spikes area
